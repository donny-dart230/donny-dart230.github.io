        <h4>By,<em> Donny Argoe</em></h4>
        <P>I asked them to take an <strong>adventure</strong><br> and appreciate the wonders around you, <br> take a moment to go on a picnic</P>
        <p>Or go climb that <strong>mountain</strong></p>
        <p>I say give child stick <br> and watch them fight that dragon,</p>
        <p>or take them to a <strong>lake</strong>, <br>and see them explore the <strong>world</strong></p>
        <p>I want them to feel the <strong>dirt</strong> beneath them, <br>ruminate around what it once was, <br>while enjoying it now</p>
        <p>But all they want to do <br>is live ordinarilly, ignoring the <strong>beauty</strong> around them,</p>
        <p>They run to far, <br>forgetting the <strong>world's</strong> already moving to fast</p>
